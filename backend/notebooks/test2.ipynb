      "**Short answer:**  \n",
      "The sky looks blue because the Earth’s atmosphere scatters short‑wavelength (blue‑violet) sunlight much more efficiently than it does longer‑wavelength (red, orange, yellow) light. Our eyes are also more sensitive to blue than to violet, so the scattered light we see is perceived as blue.\n",

      "| Step | What happens | Why it matters |\n",
      "|------|--------------|----------------|\n",
      "| 1. Sunlight reaches Earth | Sunlight is a mixture of all visible colors (a “white” spectrum). | All colors travel straight toward the planet. |\n",
      "| 2. Light meets air molecules | The atmosphere is filled with nitrogen, oxygen, and tiny particles. | These particles are **much smaller** than the wavelength of visible light (≈0.1 µm vs. 0.4–0.7 µm). |\n",
      "| 3. Rayleigh scattering | When light hits particles that are far smaller than its wavelength, it is scattered in all directions. The scattering intensity **∝ 1/λ⁴** (inverse fourth power of wavelength). | Short‑wavelength blue (≈450 nm) and violet (≈400 nm) light are scattered **~10 times** more strongly than red (≈650 nm) light. |\n",
      "| 4. Human eye response | Our eyes have three types of cones, most of which are most sensitive around 555 nm (green) and still respond well to blue, but **less** to violet (which is also partly absorbed by the ozone layer). | The sky therefore appears blue rather than violet. |\n",
      "| 5. Combined effect | The scattered blue light reaches us from every direction in the sky, while the direct sunlight (which still contains reds and yellows) continues on to our eyes as the bright “sun”. | The net visual result: a blue dome overhead with a yellowish sun. |\n",

      "## Why sunsets (and sunrises) turn red\n",
      "\n",
      "When the Sun is low on the horizon, its light must pass through **more atmosphere**—roughly 40 times more air mass than when it’s overhead. Along this longer path:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Most of the blue light is already scattered out** of the direct line of sight, leaving a higher proportion of longer wavelengths (red/orange) in the direct beam.\n",
      "2. The remaining scattered light that reaches us from the sky is also dominated by reds because the shorter wavelengths have been removed.\n",
      "3. Additional particles (dust, aerosols, water droplets) cause **Mie scattering**, which is less wavelength‑dependent and can add extra reds and pinks.\n",

      "\n",
      "| Misconception | Reality |\n",
      "|---------------|---------|\n",
      "| “The sky is blue because the Sun is blue.” | The Sun’s spectrum is essentially white; the blue color is created **after** sunlight passes through the atmosphere. |\n",
      "| “Only the atmosphere makes the sky blue.” | The same Rayleigh scattering works on any planet with a transparent gas mixture of the right composition and particle size. (Mars, for example, looks reddish because its atmosphere is thin and filled with dust.) |\n",
      "| “Violet light is scattered more, so the sky should be violet.” | Human eyes are far less sensitive to violet, and some violet is absorbed by the ozone layer, so we perceive the dominant scattered hue as blue. |\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "## A quick numerical illustration\n",
      "\n",
      "Rayleigh scattering intensity \\(I\\) ∝ \\(1/λ⁴\\).\n",
      "\n",
      "| Color | Approx. wavelength (nm) | Relative scattering (set green = 1) |\n",
      "|-------|------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n",
      "| Violet | 400 | (550/400)⁴ ≈ **2.5** |\n",
      "| Blue   | 450 | (550/450)⁴ ≈ **1.7** |\n",
      "| Green  | 550 | 1 |\n",
      "| Yellow | 580 | (550/580)⁴ ≈ 0.73 |\n",
      "| Red    | 650 | (550/650)⁴ ≈ 0.44 |\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, blue/violet light is scattered a few times more strongly than green, and many times more than red—enough to dominate the diffuse sky light we see.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Bottom line\n",
      "\n",
      "The sky is blue because **Rayleigh scattering** preferentially redirects short‑wavelength (blue) photons from the Sun in all directions, and our eyes are tuned to see that scattered light as blue. When the Sun is near the horizon, the longer path through the atmosphere removes most of that blue light, allowing the reds and oranges to dominate, which is why sunsets glow with those warm colours."
